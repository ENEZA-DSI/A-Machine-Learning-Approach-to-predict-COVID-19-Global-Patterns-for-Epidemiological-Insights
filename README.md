A Machine Learning Approach to predict COVID-19 Global Patterns for Epidemiological Insights

##  Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped global public health strategies, emphasizing the need for data-driven insights to guide interventions. Traditional epidemiological models struggle to adapt to the complex, nonlinear dynamics of a rapidly evolving pandemic. This study uses the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset to explore disease patterns using statistical analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning. We construct a comprehensive pipeline from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to predictive modeling and clustering to uncover critical indicators influencing case and death rates globally. Using classification and regression models, we identify key predictors of high case burden and total mortality. We further group countries using unsupervised learning to reveal structural epidemiological clusters. Our results highlight socioeconomic and demographic factors shaping national outcomes, offering new directions for targeted policy interventions and real-time pandemic monitoring.
