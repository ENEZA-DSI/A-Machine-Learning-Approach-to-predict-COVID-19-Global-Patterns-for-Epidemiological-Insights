#Performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) including:
- Loaded dataset and displayed structure using `.info()` and `.head()`
- Summarized data using `.describe()`
- Identified and visualized missing values
- Calculated percentage of missing values per column
- Filtered out countries with high missing data to retain cleaner subset for analysis
