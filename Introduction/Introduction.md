### Background
COVID-19, first reported in late 2019, has resulted in disruption of global economic, health, political, environmental and social activities. Positively, we have seen a rise in global digitization and changes in public health infrastructure in terms of preparedness in managing and predicting of disease patterns (Zhang et al., 2023). Epidemiological studies and analysis conducted globally have identified a wide range of context-specific factors contributing to mortality and different trends in the burden of COVID-19 disease (Peng et al., 2021). The response to the pandemic by different countries and regions in terms of the reporting, surveillance and predictions of outcomes like case and mortality has shifted with time, with a noted significant reduction in the reporting of cases in the recent past. For instance, during the period 6th January to 2nd February 2025, only 43 countries reported data on COVID-19 hospitalizations globally (WHO, 2025). With time, different challenges have been reported related to tracking, predicting, and managing the spread of the disease.

Reviews done globally on the burden of diseases and health systems reporting have noted a challenge with inadequate data, limiting projections and generalization of findings. Data sources have shown large variability in reported data. Given that machine learning models’ accuracy and predictive ability have a high dependence on the quality of data, reporting the true burden of COVID-19 over time has been a tough call, with skewness in data affecting predictive performance in different regions(Cheng, Cheng, Xu, Tan, & Bai, 2025). This calls for advanced analytical approaches able to handle heterogenous datasets to uncover patterns, improve predictive abilities and inform public health strategies.

Predictive analytics has shown promising insights into identifying disease patterns. (WHO, 2025). Major impacts have been reported with use of AI-powered anomaly detection, improving disease surveillance, resource allocation, cost reduction, interventions and patients’ outcome, that have been a challenge with traditional approaches’ post-epidemic reporting, high management cost and reactive response to diseases (Mohanadas, 2025). Machine learning models are examples of predictive modelling approaches, able to identify patterns from complex and non-linear data. Using real-time data and forecasting models is crucial to informing valuable insights and understanding of the spread and burden of a disease (Naeem et al., 2021). Machine learning models have shown promising results in predicting mortality rates and other related patterns (Ardabili et al., 2020; Naeem et al., 2021), compared to traditional epidemiological models that may fail to respond to the diverse differences in countries and regions, with limited sensitivity and adaptability.

Accurate prediction of disease patterns and outcomes of interest plays a crucial role in understanding potential future implications and informing public health decision-making (Ghafouri-Fard et al., 2021). This study aims to build on the use of artificial intelligence to identify patterns and predictors contributing to COVID-19 disease burden and to uncover hidden patterns in different countries globally.
